        <h1>Killer Sofa</h1>
        <p>I'll say this much: 'Killer sofa' knows exactly what it is,
            and has no illusions and carries no pretense <br>
            otherwise. Every story beat and detail
            is preposterously ham-handed and over the top, <br>
            yet played perfectly straight. The movie is emphatically,
            brazenly unconcerned with suspension of disbelief, <br>
            playing very fast and loose with every concept on hand
            and catapulting enthusiastically  <br>
            over the line into the realm of pure implausibility. 
            It embraces every film trope and genre convention that it can, no matter <br>
            how specious, and goes further still in making characters and scenes as ridiculously
            exaggerated as they could be.</p>
